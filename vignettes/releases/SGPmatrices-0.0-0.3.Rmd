This is first major update to the **SGPmatrices** package. The package **SGPmatrices** now contains baseline coefficient matrices from numerous states including: 

* Indiana 
    + 2021
* WIDA-Access
    + 2021

The package now contains the function [addBaselineMatrices](https://CenterForAssessment.github.io/SGPmatrices/reference/addBaselineMatrices.html) that returns a copy of the
SGP meta-data object [SGPstateData]() with the appropriate baseline matrices embedded. In baseline analyses with the [SGP package](https://sgp.io) embedding of matrices takes place automatically.

The package is under active development by staff at the [Center for Assessment](https://www.nciea.org).
